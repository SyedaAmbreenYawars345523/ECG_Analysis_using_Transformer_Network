#ECG analysis using transformer network: Two end-to-end models are proposed
                                       : Model A: Only Encoder of transformer used in model.
                                       : Model B: Both Encoder and Decoder of transformer used in model.


Dataset used : Synthetic DeepFake ECG (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vlbthambawita/deepfake-ecg?resource=download-directory)
             : only normal ECGs used for training the model
